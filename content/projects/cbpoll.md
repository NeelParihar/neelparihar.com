Designed and developed a web app for creating an online poll, where users can give votes to a poll anonymously.
It solved the problem of getting real time feedback from huge amount of participants, during webinars.


# Features of the CBPoll:

- A user can anonymously create a Poll. 
- Vote for a Poll anonymously without any registration and login.
- Only one vote per user, therefore minimizing fake votes.
- Results change dynamically no need to manually refresh. 
- Fast performance and UI inspired by the Coding Blocks theme.

# Features that can be added:

- Login functionality So that the user can manage and update the polls.
- Better visualization using graphs and piecharts.
