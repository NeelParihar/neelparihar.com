A Night Navigator is an android based groupware having different motives to render services to end user. As such now there is no other application which can provide " multiple but definite" features from various fields, hence as a result , we came with a ideology of developing this application which consists of nearby lodge/ restaurants , chemists, navigation to the desired route ,at the same time giving much prominence at the "Night Time". We thought necessary to build this project because it may help a user who is in need , let it be in case of emergency or desire for anything, mainly during the hours of darkness, making it more responsive and secure. To give an Example:

- Searching for nearest Hospitals available at night and for the chemist at the same time.
- Nearest Restaurants or inn available.
